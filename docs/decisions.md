# Architecture Decision Log

Short, append-only records. **Agents: add an entry when you make a decision that future work must respect**
(new dependency, changed convention, rejected approach). Newest at the bottom.

Format: `## D-NNN — Title (YYYY-MM-DD)` then **Context / Decision / Consequences** in a few lines each.

## D-001 — WebGPU first, WebGL2 fallback (2026-10-24)

**Context:** We need modern GPU features (compute for particles, TSL node materials) and broad reach.
**Decision:** three.js `WebGPURenderer` from `three/webgpu`; materials written in TSL. `?renderer=webgl` forces the fallback.
**Consequences:** No `ShaderMaterial`/GLSL. Every feature must render on both backends. GPU-compute features need a WebGL2 degradation path.

## D-002 — Renderer-agnostic deterministic sim (2026-10-24)

**Context:** Sim may move to a worker or to Rust under Tauri; tests must be headless.
**Decision:** `src/sim`, `src/ecs`, `src/core`, `src/content` never import three.js, render, ui or world (lint-enforced). Randomness only via `Rng`. All mutations go through commands.
**Consequences:** Renderers mirror sim state through events and per-frame reads, never the other way round.

## D-003 — Chunked instancing with shared materials (2026-10-24)

**Context:** Tens of thousands of plants and building pieces; draw-call budget < 300.
**Decision:** `ChunkedInstancer`: one `InstancedMesh` per (piece, 64-tile chunk); per-instance `aParams` vec4 + `instanceColor`; ~15 shared materials.
**Consequences:** New visuals should be kit pieces or materials, not one-off meshes. TSL `positionNode` runs _after_ instancing, so growth scaling is a CPU matrix tween; wind sway is GPU-side.

## D-004 — Content as auto-discovered data files (2026-10-24)

**Decision:** `import.meta.glob` registers every file in `src/content/buildings/` (sorted by path, for stable indices).
**Consequences:** Renaming a building file can change registry indices; saves store string ids, so they are unaffected.

## D-005 — Vanilla DOM HUD (2026-10-24)

**Decision:** No UI framework; `ui/dom.ts` hyperscript helper; throttled updates (~5 Hz) with `setText` to avoid layout churn.

## D-006 — Singapore-inspired island world (2026-10-24)

**Context:** v3 requirements make the world an island city-state.
**Decision:** `sim/terrain.ts` shapes a main island (warped superellipse) with central hills and reservoirs, a southern bay and river, and three islets, over an ocean floor. Pure function of (x, z, seed, size).
**Consequences:** Buildable land is scarce by design. Land reclamation (Phase 10) will edit corner heights through a command and must rebuild terrain chunks.
